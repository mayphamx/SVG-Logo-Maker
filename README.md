# SVG-Logo-Maker
UT's Fullstack Flex Web Development Bootcamp - Challenge 10

## Description
This challenge was created to build logos upon users specific requests to prevent an outside source creating logos. This activity allows the user to input text, text color, shape, and shape color in the command line that will open a svg file to export their designated logo. This activity also runs tests in a specified javascript file that passes with no failures. Inquirer 8.2.4 and jest were installed in order to make this work run as seamlessly as possible.
